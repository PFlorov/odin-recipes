    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This zucchini soup with cream cheese warms your belly on a chilly winter
      day.<br />
      It's fast, easy, and inexpensive to make, so it's great for when an
      unexpected guest comes over.<br />
      I keep it on hand at all times. It freezes well too!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups water</li>
      <li>5 zucchini, sliced</li>
      <li>7 cubes chicken bouillon</li>
      <li>
        1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened and cut into 4 sections
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir water, zucchini, and bouillon cubes together in a stockpot; bring
        to a boil.<br />Reduce the heat to medium, then cover and simmer,
        stirring occasionally, until zucchini is tender, about 20 minutes.

      <li>
        Carefully drop cream cheese into the stockpot. Cook and stir until
        melted, about 5 minutes. Blend soup with an immersion blender until
        smooth.
